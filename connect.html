        <h3>Why Branden Husted?</h3>
            <div class="greeting">Dear future employer,</div>
            <div class = "end">I am writing to express my keen interest in the opportunity to contribute to your business.
            I love to go running, play music on guitar, and I love to code and solve problems, all of which have given me a strong foundation of discipline, creativity, and technical skills.
            I have a strong foundation in technical skills and practice my skills using leetcode and I find creative ways to use my skills from the classroom in the real world like my student grader position for computer science I have on my resume. I learn to have a passion for continuous learning, and a commitment to excellence and I believe these traits could be a valuable asset to your business.</div>

            <div class = "end">My upbringing was significantly influenced by my involvement in the Boy Scouts, where I proudly achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. 
                This experience ingrained in me the values of leadership, perseverance, and dedication. Furthermore, my active participation in Cross Country, Track, Marching Band, and Jazz Band throughout high school honed my abilities in teamwork and discipline. 
                I was deeply involved with Outreach Christian Church in Lake Odessa, where I joined the worship band and played guitar for the congregation.
                Through this experience, I developed a profound relationship with God, feeling that my contribution served as a beacon for my church and inspired others to support our community.</div>
            <div class = "end">My commitment to faith and service led me to pursue higher education at a private Christian college called Calvin University in my new declared major, computer science.
                I love computer science because I love learning new things and challenging myself to dream big and open up more opportunities for other people.
                I have learned so much in my time at Calvin and I have loved meeting new people and broading my new professional network. I am excited about the possibility of including you in my network as well!

            I was told as I grew up to never quit what I started and to give your all in everything that you do. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of discussing how my background can be an asset to your team.</div>

            <h3>Sincerely,</h3>
            <div class = "signoff">Branden Husted</div>

    <div id="funActivities">
        <h3>Fun Activites Branden Enjoys</h3>
        <div>I played Guitar in my High School's Jazz band for 7 years and I really enjoyed it! I challenged myself to learn complicated chords and took lessons outside of class. I also had a few solos to rock hard during concerts!</div>
        <div>My love for playing Guitar led me to love technology because of the experimental nature and constant leaning Jazz Band had instilled in me.</div>
        <div>I enjoy video games like Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart. I am also enjoying the fast exhilarating gameplay and music of Sonic games.</div>
        <div>One of my favorite jobs I have worked so far was a fudge shop in Mackinac island called Kilwins because I was able to demonstrate customer service and communicate effectively. This skill can help a ton in the feild of tech where communication is getting so much more important.</div>
        <div>Another one of my favorite jobs was when I was a student researcher on a open source project called PyStage. Where we helped develop a program to convert Scratch programs to Python equilvalent programs.</div>
        <div>We seeked to help new programmers bridge the gap between blocks-based programming to text-based programming. I worked on the back-end and front-end of the project helping develop functions that worked in python exactly the same as they do in Scratch using PyGame.</div>
        <div>I also was able to present my work in Washington DC for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</div>
        <div>In College I loved to go camping on the weekends and go kayaking and hiking because it reminded me Boy Scouts and how even being a computer scientist I still love the outdoors and the memories made on our wacky adventures.</div>
        <div>I love to run as well and I try to keep fit and healthy and love my neighbors as I love myself.</div>
        <div>I am very involved with my church and I use to play for the church's band and I have had a new love for God ever since that experience.</div>
        <div>I make an effort to do community service for my community VITA was a program I was involved in that helped people get returns for their taxes.</div>
        <div> I also was apart of a Codeathon in Colorado Springs where I helped develop Alexa support for an app called Babel that is used now to help missionaries learn ubscure languages in Africa and other places in the world.</div>
