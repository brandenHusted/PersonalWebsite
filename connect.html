        <h3>Why Branden Husted?</h3>
            <div>Dear future employer,</div>
            <div>I am writing to express my keen interest in the opportunity to contribute to your business.</div>
            <div>My hobbies include running, music, and coding, all of which have instilled in me a strong foundation of discipline, creativity, and technical skills.</div>
            <div>I have a strong foundation in technical skills and practice my skills using leetcode, a passion for continuous learning, and a commitment to excellence and I believe these traits could be a valuable asset to your business.</div>

            <div>My upbringing was significantly influenced by my involvement in the Boy Scouts, where I proudly achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. This experience ingrained in me the values of leadership, perseverance, and dedication.</div>
            <div>Furthermore, my active participation in Cross Country, Track, Marching Band, and Jazz Band throughout high school honed my abilities in teamwork and discipline.</div>

            <div>I was deeply involved with Outreach Christian Church in Lake Odessa, where I joined the worship band and played guitar for the congregation.</div>
            <div>Through this experience, I developed a profound relationship with God, feeling that my contribution served as a beacon for my church and inspired others to support our community.</div>
            <div>My commitment to faith and service led me to pursue higher education at a private Christian college called Calvin University in my new declared major, computer science.</div>
            <div>I love computer science because I love learning new things and challenging myself to dream big and open up more opportunities for other people.</div>
            <div>I have learned so much in my time at Calvin and I have loved meeting new people and broading my new professional network. I am excited about the possibility of including you in my network as well!</div>

            <div>I was told as I grew up to never quit what I started and to give your all in everything that you do. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of discussing how my background can be an asset to your team.</div>
            <h3>In best regards,</h3>
            <h3>Sincerely,</h3>
            <div>Branden Husted</div>
