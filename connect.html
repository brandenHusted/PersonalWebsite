        <h3>Why Branden Husted?</h3>
            <div class="greeting">Dear future employer,</div>
            <div class = "end">I am writing to express my keen interest in the opportunity to contribute to your business.
            I love to go running, play music on guitar, and I love to code and solve problems, all of which have given me a strong foundation of discipline, creativity, and technical skills.
            I have a strong foundation in technical skills and practice my skills using leetcode and I find creative ways to use my skills from the classroom in the real world like my student grader position for computer science I have on my resume. I learn to have a passion for continuous learning, and a commitment to excellence and I believe these traits could be a valuable asset to your business.</div>

            <div class = "end">My upbringing was significantly influenced by my involvement in the Boy Scouts, where I proudly achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. 
                This experience ingrained in me the values of leadership, perseverance, and dedication. Furthermore, my active participation in Cross Country, Track, Marching Band, and Jazz Band throughout high school honed my abilities in teamwork and discipline. 
                I was deeply involved with Outreach Christian Church in Lake Odessa, where I joined the worship band and played guitar for the congregation.
                Through this experience, I developed a profound relationship with God, feeling that my contribution served as a beacon for my church and inspired others to support our community.</div>
            <div class = "end">My commitment to faith and service led me to pursue higher education at a private Christian college called Calvin University in my new declared major, computer science.
                I love computer science because I love learning new things and challenging myself to dream big and open up more opportunities for other people.
                I have learned so much in my time at Calvin and I have loved meeting new people and broading my new professional network. I am excited about the possibility of including you in my network as well!

            I was told as I grew up to never quit what I started and to give your all in everything that you do. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of discussing how my background can be an asset to your team.</div>

            <h3>Sincerely,</h3>
            <div class = "signoff">Branden Husted</div>
